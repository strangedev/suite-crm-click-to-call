# SuiteCRM `tel://`-based click-to-call

This extensions enables the simplest form of click to call functionality for SuiteCRM.
Once installed, a "click-to-call" button will be added to every telephone number displayed.
When clicking this button, the `tel://` protocol is used to launch the softphone of your choice
on the client PC.

As this extension is intended for use with softphones, a program capable of handling
the `tel://` protocol needs to be installed on the client in order to start the call.
